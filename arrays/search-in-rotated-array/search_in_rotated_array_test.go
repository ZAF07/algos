/*
There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1

		// Because we know that the given array is already sorted in ascending order and we are trying to find the smallest possible element in the given array, when a rotation happens within an ordered array, the smallest element (the first element in an unsorted array) will be moved to the right k number of times. So if the middle element is larget than the first element in a rotated array, we know that the smallest possible element will definitely be somewhere to the right

		// ðŸ’¡WHY DO WE BRING THE RIGHT POINTER DOWN IF NUMS[MID] < NUMS[0] ??
		// Because we are trying to find the smallest possible element here (the pivot or where we can split the rotated array into two to easily perform Binary Search on afterwards) know that the array is already sorted in ascending order, any number to the right of an element will only grow larger (unless the array is rotated of course!)
		// So if the current middle element (nums[(left + right) / 2]) is lesser than the first element (nums[0]), knowing that elements to the right are only going to be larger, there is the possibility that num[mid + 1] could be larger than or equal to nums[0], so we can safely narrow down the search for the smallest element from the current left pointer up until the middle element
