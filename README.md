### Introduction
The Random Algorithm Tests Repository is a collection of algorithms and their corresponding solutions. The goal of this repository is for me to get better at solvinga diverse set of algorithmic problems along with multiple solutions, showcasing different approaches, optimizations, and trade-offs.

### Usage
To use this repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZAF07/algos.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
```bash
cd path/to/your/directory/algos
```

Browse through the various algorithm directories to find the specific problem you are interested in. Each directory contains a detailed explanation of the problem and one or more solution files.

Open the solution file(s) using your preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

Study the solutions provided and analyze the different approaches taken to solve the problem.

Modify or adapt the solutions according to your needs or use them as a reference to implement your own solution.

Test and evaluate the solutions based on your requirements and constraints.

### Running algos with Go
For solutions in Go, I have implemented them in the Go testing package.

To run the solutions with Go, run the following command:
```bash
go test <path>/<to>/<_test.go>
```
And the following to view all logs in stdout:
```bash
go test <path>/<to>/<_test.go> -test.v
```


### Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome and encouraged. If you have a new algorithmic problem or a different solution to an existing problem, follow these steps to contribute:

Fork the repository on GitHub.

Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

Create a new branch for your contribution:
```bash
git checkout -b my-contribution
```
Implement your algorithm or add your solution file(s).

Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "Add my solution to Problem XYZ"
```

Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub:
```bash
git push origin my-contribution
```

Open a pull request from your branch to the main repository.

Once your pull request is reviewed and accepted, it will be merged into the main repository, and your contribution will be included.
