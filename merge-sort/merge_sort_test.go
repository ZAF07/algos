/*
Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Explanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).

Example 2:
Input: nums = [5,1,1,2,0,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,5]
Explanation: Note that the values of nums are not necessairly unique.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104
-5 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 104

NOTES: Merge sort has a runtime Big0 of O(nlogn). On larger arrays, Merge sort will be faster than Bubble Sort with a runtiem Big0 of O(n2)
	On smaller arrays though, because Merge Sort has to merge/create new arrays, it might be better to perform Bubble Sort

Example:

	ðŸš¨ To be continued. Will try to draw a diagram for better understanding as recursive algos are quite a lot for me to keep track as well!
	1. When merge([2,3]) is called, it will then again call merge, this time with merge(2) & merge(3). This will add to the call stack like so:
	   M[3,2,5,4]
	   ^      ^
	   / \    / \
	   S(3,2)  S(5,4)
	   M[3,2]  M[5,4]
	   ^	    ^
	   /   \     /  \
	   M[2] M[3] M[5] M[4]
